This repository is created for my Solidity project from Metacrafters. The project involves learning about various aspects of blockchain development, including cryptography, Ethereum, EVM, and deploying/testing code.

Learning Objectives
During the creation of this repository, I have learned about the following:

Cryptography for the blockchain: The project involved understanding how cryptography is used to secure transactions on the blockchain. I learned about various cryptographic algorithms, such as SHA-256 and RSA, and how they are used to protect the integrity of transactions on the blockchain.

Key features of Ethereum: I gained a deeper understanding of the Ethereum blockchain and its features, including smart contracts, decentralized applications, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

EVM and its usage: I learned about the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and how to use it to execute smart contracts. This involved understanding the EVM's opcode instructions and the role they play in executing code on the blockchain.

Deploying and testing code: I learned how to deploy and test Solidity code on the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix IDE and Ganache.

Creating an ERC20 token: Finally, I learned how to create an ERC20 token, which is a standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This involved understanding the ERC20 token standard and writing Solidity code to implement the token.

Project Structure
This repository contains the Solidity code for the project, as well as any additional files and documentation that were created during its development. The code is organized into the following directories:

contracts: Contains the Solidity code for the smart contracts used in the project, including the ERC20 token contract.
tests: Contains the test scripts used to test the Solidity code.
docs: Contains any documentation created during the project, including tutorials, guides, and reference material.
Usage
To use this repository, you will need to have a working knowledge of Solidity and Ethereum development. You can clone the repository to your local machine and use tools like Remix IDE and Ganache to deploy and test the code.
